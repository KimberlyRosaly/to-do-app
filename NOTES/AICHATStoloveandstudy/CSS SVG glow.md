I want to make my tree svg glow with a soft orange color. can you show me how to do this?


Certainly To make your tree SVG glow with a soft orange color, you can use CSS animations and the
box-shadow
property. Here's an example:

@keyframes glowing {
  0% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 5px 3px rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.8);
  }
  50% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 15px 10px rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.6);
  }
  100% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 5px 3px rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.8);
  }
}

.tree-svg g {
  animation: glowing 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
In this example, the
glowing
animation is defined with keyframes that gradually change the
box-shadow
property. The animation is then applied to the
<g>
elements within the
.tree-svg
class. Adjust the color values and animation duration as needed.

Apply the
.tree-svg
class to the container element wrapping your tree SVG. For example, if your tree SVG is inside a
<div>
with a class of
tree-container
, you can use the following HTML:

<div class="tree-container">
  <svg class="tree-svg" ...>
    <!-- your tree SVG code here -->
  </svg>
</div>
Please note that you may need to adapt the CSS selectors based on your specific SVG structure and class names.
